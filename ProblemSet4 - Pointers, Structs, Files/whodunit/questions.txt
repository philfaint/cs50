1.  stdint is a header file that contains declarations for special data types like uint8_t,
    which is an unsigned int of at least 8 bits.
2.  to define a certain type that is at least 8,32,32 and 16 bits. In case when we declare
    a variable int, on different OS and processor, in can store different amount of memory,
    while uint8_t tells the compiler to have at least 8 bits for this variable
3.  8 bits, 32 bits unsigned, 32 bits signed, 16 bits
4.  424d
5.  bfSize - the total size of the actual file including pixels, padding and headers
    biSize - total size of image including pixels and padding
6.  if biHeight is negative, than the beginning of the image is bottom top
7.  bitCount
8.  fopen may return NULL if it's not able to open or create a file
9.  3rd argument of the fread function because it reads 1 struct from the file
10. padding is equal to 0
11. fseek function changes the position of the cursor inside the file
12. SEEK_CUR in fseek function as argument sets the original cursor position to the current position.
